Cheap and powerful DIY airsoft gun



I tried to build the cheapest airsoft gun without sacrificing power and accuracy. Also without using any off the shelf airsoft parts. The power source is a paint can pumped to a 10bar max pressure with a bike pump. It make the build cheap to run as the only consumables are the bb's.



The air is delivered to the hop-up unit by a solenoid valve. The automatic reloading after each shot is managed by a small servo. The brain of all this is an Arduino Nano wich has three switch connected to it : trigger switch hidden inside, safety switch, fire mode switch

Everything is powered by a18650 cell and a buck-boost converter



The magasine can hold 25 bb and a full tank of air will last me 3 magazines. I know that it cannot compete whith a high end airsoft replica but i'm very happy of the results. It has a great accuracy, more power than needed and it can be built for less than 50€ !!!!



You'll find here all the STL's, the bill of materials, the schematic and the code.
